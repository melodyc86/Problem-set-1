# Description of my Presentation:

My presentation discussed the topic of AI Adaptation in Game Design. 
I did this by first defining what AI Adaptation in game design is and the 4 most commonly used methods.
I then elaborated on each method used and gave an example of a game in which it is used. I further elaborated how it worked in the game as well as how
it improved the game's design overall.
